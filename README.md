SocialCloak: The ultimate open source Facebook / Twitter PII scrubber

SocialCloak is made in pure python, debugged in modern AI, and left open-source for inprovement and future development purposes.

SocialCloak scans a user's Facebook And Twitter profiles for PII (personal identifier information) such as email addresses, phone numbers, street addresses, etc, and deletes the posts, tweets, comments, or retweets with the PII. Leaving you, with a much smaller digital footprint.

SocialCloak is still in development, so please use it with caution. To ensure SocialCloak only deletes what you like, please take a moment to peruse the full code before usage. 

SocialCloak successfull script run REQUIREMENTS: a Twitter API key, a Twitter API secret, a Twitrer access token, a twitter access secret, a facebook access token, a facebook user ID, and knowledge of the Facebook Graph usage.

Social Cloak is developed by @abtzpro @AdamR @HelloSecurity
